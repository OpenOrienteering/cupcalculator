# OpenOrienteering CupCalculator

**CupCalculator** is a program which calculates scorings from race results.
It takes the runners' race times and calculates points for every runner
(and optionally also for teams) according to a set of rules which are specified
in advance. This makes the point calculation a matter of a few clicks.
