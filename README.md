**CupCalculator** is a program which calculates scorings from race results. It takes the runners' race times and calculates points for every runner (and optionally also for teams) according to a set of rules which are specified in advance. This makes the point calculation a matter of a few clicks.

A word of warning, though: **always** do a quick check of the calculated points before publishing them! I cannot take responsibility for incorrectly calculated points.


**Features**

  * Import race times from [Sportsoftware](http://www.sportsoftware.de) CSV exports (OE 2003 / 2010 and OS 2003 / 2010)

  * Calculation of scorings for single races and series scorings, with adjustable settings including handicapping based on age

  * Recognition and correction of misspelled clubs & runner names

  * Presentation mode for prize giving ceremonies

  * Calculated scorings can be exported as CSV, to be loaded into Excel / LibreOffice Calc to prepare the results as PDF

  * Works on Windows and Linux (when compiled yourself); Languages: English and German
